title: Why did you switch to frontend development after studying design?
---

The rapidly changing and multi-domain collaborative nature of web development made me want to pursue this field.

<br />

People who changed career paths often have a higher chance of being perceived as inexperience, only for pursuing higher salaries or still testing the waters in a new field. However, I believe in this era, especially in frontend development, things are changing so rapidly that everyone is constantly at a new starting point.

<br />

I've written over a hundred technical articles purely out of passion and solving problems. I also have relatively mature and rich web development experience and a strong drive for learning. This allows me to approach problems from a perspective different from traditional developers.
