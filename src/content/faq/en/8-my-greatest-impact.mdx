title: What impact are you most proud of?
---

If not limited to work, the impact I'm most proud of is developing the habit of long-term self-improvement and continuous writing, as well as serving as a frontend teaching assistant. This has not only helped me but also many others, with an influence that spans the entire frontend industry, which gives me a big sense of fulfillment.

<br />

Regarding work specifically, it's establishing order from scratch within the team, helping current and future team members achieve their goals more efficiently. For example:

<br />

ðŸ’¡ Before I joined the company, there were no onboarding documents. So I started confirming every detail and creating documentation, allowing all members to refer to and align their steps. (How to plan for i18n support? How to manage files? Why were certain decisions made at the time? ...)

ðŸ’¡ Dig into frontend architecture to solve larger, more comprehensive problems (Monorepo)

ðŸ’¡ Questioning and improving existing workflows (CI/CD, test deployment automation, implementing best practices)
