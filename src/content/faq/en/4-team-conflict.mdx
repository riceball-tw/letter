title: How would you approach team conflicts?
---

I really like the concept of "Disagree and commit," and use this approach to face conflicts within the team.

<br />

It's normal for a team to have different voices, because of each person has unique perspectives and different life experiences. Many problems even don't have a single best solution, and there are usually multiple trade-offs to consider. Therefore, we still can find out through "best choice based on team consensus," and once the team is reached agreement, each member commits fully to act according to that decision.

<br />

For example, when raising issues or proposing changes, I always analyze my own views and discuss them using the goal-problem-solution approach. I don't think arguments are inherently bad, but the ultimate purpose of arguing should be to seek consensus.

<br />

Solving problems requires rationality. If rational people can't reach a consensus or resolve issues through "Disagree and commit," it's likely that the goals or the problems themselves are not aligned.
