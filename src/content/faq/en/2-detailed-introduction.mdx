title: Introduce yourself in detail

My experience in the web field can be traced back to high school. Although my path was always leaned towards graphic design, <a class="underline" href="https://www.webdong.dev/en/shortpost/story-between-me-and-web-design/#story-between-me-and-web-design">advancing my education through web design competitions</a> led me to cross over into frontend development. Since then, I've tried various jobs such as freelance web projects and working as a frontend teaching assistant. I've shared my understanding and insights on problems through my <a class="underline" href="https://www.webdong.dev/">blog</a> and <a class="underline" href="https://www.threads.net/@webdong.dev">social media</a>.

<br />

After graduation, I discovered my interest in education-related products and cross-domain collaborations. This led me to join <a class="underline" href="https://hiskio.com/en/">HiSKIO</a> as a full-time frontend engineer. In this role, I've been involved with various aspects including performance optimization, i18n support, architecture (Monorepo), testing (unit/E2E), and more.

<br />

Ultimately, I aspire to work in an environment that is rational and full of challenges, allowing for the collision of different ideas and improvement. This would enhance my own input and enable me to consolidate and output more content on my blog, benefiting both myself and community.
